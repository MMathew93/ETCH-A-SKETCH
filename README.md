I started the REAL barebones of this. I have an idea of what I want to do but I am npt entirely sure on how to manipulate the DOM how I want it too. I nee to re-read the chapter and go back before I mindlessly try to google an answer.

I have been studying DOM stuff more and more, I have a much better understanding then when I first began, but I'm still not fully grasping it.
Worked on some of the inner coding but it isn't working, I'm missing something, unsure of how obvious it is or not just yet.

I put off working on this project for quite some time till the weekend. I have made loads of hedway after giving myself time to re-study the DOM and get a better understanding of it. I have a lot done, I am still working on prettying it up some more but the basics are there. The grid size is still wonky, I need to fix the container as it it just filling the entire webpage with cells instead of confining them into one container size.

Got the grid and semi working cancel option to work correctly. Next is colors and oevrall prettyness of web page.
