I started the REAL barebones of this. I have an idea of what I want to do but I am npt entirely sure on how to manipulate the DOM how I want it too. I nee to re-read the chapter and go back before I mindlessly try to google an answer.

I have been studying DOM stuff more and more, I have a much better understanding then when I first began, but I'm still not fully grasping it.

WOrked on some of the inner coding but it isn't working, I'm missing something, unsure of how obvious it is or not just yet.
